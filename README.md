# Data Structures and Algorithm Exercises

History of the DSA problems that i've solved. Implemented in multiple languages (TypeScript, Java, Python). Problems are classified by category and can have multiple solutions. Big O complexity analysis of each inside the notes.

Current goal is to solve 100 problems.
